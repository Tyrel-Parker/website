    "content": "When I decided to build my personal website, I had a choice to make: use a modern framework like React or Next.js, or stick with the fundamentals. I chose vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and here's why.\n\nFirst, let me explain my requirements. I wanted a site that could showcase my applications, photography, book reviews, and eventually a blog. I needed it to be fast, maintainable, and easy to deploy.\n\nThe decision to go vanilla wasn't just about simplicity—it was about understanding the web platform at its core. Every framework is built on these fundamentals, so mastering them makes you a better developer overall.\n\nFor the design, I went with a modern gradient background and glassmorphism effects. The CSS uses backdrop-filter for that nice blurred glass effect you see on the cards. Here's a key snippet:\n\n```css\n.container {\n  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95);\n  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);\n  border-radius: 20px;\n}\n```\n\nThe JavaScript architecture is modular. I separated concerns by using JSON files for data and keeping the logic clean. Each section (apps, photography, books) loads its data independently.\n\nOne interesting challenge was implementing the expandable book reviews. I used CSS transitions with max-height to create smooth expand/collapse animations without JavaScript animation libraries.\n\nDeployment to GitHub Pages was straightforward—just push to the main branch and enable Pages in the repository settings. No build process needed!\n\nThe result? A fast-loading, maintainable website that showcases my work effectively. Sometimes the simple approach is the best approach.",
