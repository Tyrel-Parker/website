    "shortDescription": "A woman finds herself in a magical library between life and death, exploring infinite versions of her life.",
    "fullDescription": "Matt Haig creates a touching exploration of regret, possibility, and the meaning of life through the story of Nora Seed, who finds herself in a mystical library where each book represents a different life she could have lived. While the premise is fantastical, the emotional core is deeply human - dealing with depression, regret, and the question of whether any life is worth living. The book serves as both an entertaining story and a gentle philosophical meditation on choice, regret, and finding meaning in our actual lives rather than our imagined alternatives.",
